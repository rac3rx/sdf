# two levels deep here, you can adjust that with the "-l" flag. 
wget -r -l 2 www.targetwebsite.com

# Next, we replace the spaces with new line characters and produce a uniq list:
grep -hr "" www.targetwebsite.com/ | tr '[:space:]' '\n' | sort | uniq > wordlist.lst

# Next step is to remove the weird characters. Don't worry, we can put them back. 
# This primarily removes the HTML tags and such:
# Note: I do not remove the parentheses characters "()". We probably need to move 
# to perl regex or something similar to do that. 
egrep -v '('\,'|'\;'|'\}'|'\{'|'\<'|'\>'|'\:'|'\='|'\"'|'\/'|'\/'|'\['|'\]')' wordlist.lst | sort -u > wordlist.clean.lst

# Below, we append the default John the ripper password list to our custom list:
cat password.lst >> wordlist.clean.lst

# Now, we might have duplicates and since we removed all special
# characters (Well, most of them anyhow) we need to put them back. Below
# we run John to re-generate our unique wordlist, apply some rules, and
# output to standard out:

# For bonus points you can modify the rules so that it does a better job
# of adding in special characters (such as replacing all "i" with "1").
# We'll leave this exercise up to the reader.
john --wordlist=wordlist.clean.lst --rules --stdout | uniq > final.wordlist.lst
