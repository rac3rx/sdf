To whom it may concern,

 

Are you looking for a Network & Systems Administrator, with a "can do attitude"?

Great!  This  Network & Systems Administrator is experienced from the ground up!

My repertoire consists of hardware knowledge as well as software:

 

Unix, BSD, Linux, Macintosh, Novell, Microsoft, LAN, WAN or WiFi.

 

I  thrive  in heterogeneous networks regardless of the manufacturer, platform or

source.  Welcoming the race and challenges that come with the territory. Whether

it is working alone or in a team-playing environment.

 

Currently, I am in the US Army as a network and systems administror, training to become

a  MIS with a minor in Religion at Liberty University, and have served for a total of

14 years in the US Armed Forces.

 

My strong points are:

 

        * Strong communication skills

        * Excellent attention to detail

        * Ability to multi-task in a fast paced environment

        * Great interpersonal skills and customer service

        * Extremely motivated with unlimited initiative

 

My weak point(s) are:

 

        * Inability to leave a job unfinished

 

These  skills  above  are constantly being developed since they were acquired in

the military. I hold them dearly and believe in leading by example. Please, find

my contact information above. I look forward to speaking with you soon.

 

Sincerely,

Hammond, C.J. (MCP, Net+)
