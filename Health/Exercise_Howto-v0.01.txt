Basic Bike Training

A.  aerobic
B.  glycolytic
A.  ATP systems
   1  ATP system uses adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
      to produce on-the-spot-energy.
      a)  sprinter in us all
      b)  is the power to give 100% effort -- maximal
          power
      c)  only for a few seconds
      d)  broken apart chemically for a quick surge of
          energy
   2  ATP depleted
      a)  gone in 10-30 seconds
      b)  replenish stores of ATP
      c)  time to replenish ATP is called recovery time.
   3  Train ATP systems
      a)  maximal effort for short durations
      b)  followed by complete recovery
      c)  aka burst exercises such as sprints
      d)  must be used sparingly in exercise routine
B  Glycolytic aka anaerobic system
   1  last longer than ATP system
   2  not as intense
   3  average person work muscles 2-10 minutes on 
      anaerobic system
   4  within this system, glycogen is broken down to 
      lactic acid in an oxygen-poor muscle
   5  burning sensation within the muscles -- lactic acid
   6  can increase anaerobic capacity with training
C  Aerobic
D  Cross Training
   1  weight training thickens your tendons and toughens
      the tendon's attachment to the bone.
      a)  important for injury prevention
      b)  knee curls for the hamstrings and biceps femorus
      c)  knee extension for the quadriceps
      d)  push-offs for the gastrocnemius
   2  work opposite muscles
      a) pull-ups vs pull-downs
      b) push-ups vs seated row
   3  other sports
      a) kick bocking
      b) running
   4  upper body workout
   5  trunk workout
      a) back extensions
         1) with an exercise ball

         2)  start with straight back bend until 90 degrees
             and return to starting position
      b)  aqua-man
          1) lay face down, alternate raising your left arm
             and right leg and right arm with left leg
          2)  keep leg straight and try keeping thigh off floor

      c)  RDL (roman dead lift)
          1) hamstrings and lower back
          2)  hold barbell or straight bar about shoulder width
              apart
          3)  keep natural curve of back, bend at waist knees
              slightly bent
          4)  Bend until you feel a good stretch in your ham-
              strings return to start position
      d)  back squat
      e)  abdominals
      f)  back row
   6  leg exercises
      a)  lunges
      b)  heel raises
      c)  step-ups with dumb bells
D  Condition our bodies into powerful functional machines
   1  power is functional application of speed and strength
   2  something is functional if it is used to contribute to
      the development of maintenance of a larger whole
E  Become what we believe
   1  believe in yourself and accomplish goals
   2  know that you belong and always show confidence
F  Set Goals for yoursefl

   2  talk to it positively
   3  eventually it will talk to you positively
   4  affirmations replace negative thoughts
H  Visualization
   1  envision yourself in competetion
   2  being successful
   3  5-10 daily meditating
   4  positive thoughts breed more positive thoughts
   5  "Defeat is a state of mind. No one is ever defeated until
      defeat has been accepted as a reality. To me, defeat in
      anything is merely temporary, and its punishment is but
      an urge for me to greater effort to achieve my goal.
      Defeat simply tells me that something is wrong in my
      doing; it is a path leading to success and truth."
      -- Bruce Lee
I  King of all exercises  -- the squat
   1  exercises categorized as closed chain or open chain
      a)  body parts are links
      b)  closed chain is when a body part or link is fixed
      c)  open chain is where no links within the chain are fixed
   2  squat is closed chain
   3  leg extension is open chain     
J  Speed training and strength/stamina training
K  MHR -- Maximum Heart Rate
   1  MHR Age Predicted
     a)  220 - AGE = MHR
         e.g.  220 - 35 = 185
     b)  MHR Chart
        The Healthy Heart Zone = 105 -125 bpm
        The Aerobic Zone = 125 - 145 bpm
        The Anaerobic Zone = 145 - 165 bpm
        The Red Zone = 165 - 185 bpm
   2  Age Predicted MHR Variation
      a) 205 - (AGE/2) = MHR
      b) 205 - (35/2) = 188
      c) MHR Chart
        The Healthy Heart Zone = 108 -128 bpm
        The Aerobic Zone = 128 - 148 bpm
        The Anaerobic Zone = 148 - 168 bpm
