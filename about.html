      I'm from Houston, Texas served in the Navy from 86-95 (stationed in Catania, Italy and Norfolk, Virginia).  I was an Aviation Machinest
      mate (jet mechanic, grease monkey, or nose picker).  Thereafter I became a civilian and worked at various places as IT from the ground up
      (hardware, software, networking, and a little code here and there (DOS, Win 3.1x, Novell, GNU/Linux, OS/2, and BSDs).  Microsoft has just
      kept evolving along with every other technology under the sun.  Oh yeah, I went to boot camp in San Diego, California.
      In 2001, I started missing the military so I joined the Naval Reserve as an IT, but didn't like the Naval Reserve and tried joining the
      Marines but couldn't get the age waiver.  Afterwards I went into the Army Reserve as an infantryman.  Now I was hooked and transfered to
      active duty  ( I was changed to a NBC (nuclear, biological, and chemical at the whims of the Army).  This happened in 2004, it took three
      years to change my MOS to Signal (IT).  Soon after I was airborne.  Now I am trying to go Ranger it should happen this year if it's God's
      will in 2009.  Basic was at Ft. Leornardwood, and I was stationed at Ft. Polk, Louisiana, and currently serving in Latin America and
      the Carribean.

      Most importantly I am a christian with four wonderful children, Christopher, Breanna, Alyssa, and Dakota to whom my life is dedicated as
      Jesus has inspired me to be from one father to another.  I am blessed with one brother and sister, Jon and Laura.  They in turn have
      their families that make it a more enriched experience.  My parents have parted and I miss them sorely.  I'm no preacher or something to
      put on a pedestal.  However, after a fall I get up and press forward and always know where to turn to ie Jesus.  At least the devil
      can't tempt me there with an undeserving attitude.  This is a good snapshot of whom I am and some of my interests.

     Special thanks to my children's mother Blanca, for doing such a great job in raising our children, without me.
