      This site is dedicated in sharing knowledge and memories plus as a learing tool for me and whomever else finds it as useful.  Additionally
      this site was written with VIM by hand using tutorials, cheatsheets, and HOWTOs.

      I'm from Houston, Texas served in the Navy from 86-95 (stationed in Catania, Italy and Norfolk, Virginia).  I was an Aviation Machinest 
      mate (jet mechanic, grease monkey, or nose picker).  Thereafter I became a civilian and worked at various places as IT from the ground up 
      (hardware, software, networking, and a little code here and there (DOS, Win 3.1x, Novell, GNU/Linux, OS/2, and BSDs).  Microsoft has just 
      kept evolving along with every other technology under the sun.  Oh yeah, I went to boot camp in San Diego, California.
	<BR></BR>
      In 2001, I started missing the military so I joined the Naval Reserve as an IT, but didn't like the Naval Reserve and tried joining the 
      Marines but couldn't get the age waiver.  Afterwards I went into the Army Reserve as an infantryman.  Now I was hooked and transfered to 
      active duty  ( I was changed to a NBC (nuclear, biological, and chemical at the whims of the Army).  This happened in 2004, it took three 
      years to change my MOS to Signal (IT).  Soon after I was airborne.  Now I am trying to go Ranger it should happen this year if it's God's 
      will in 2009.  Basic was at Ft. Leornardwood, and I was stationed at Ft. Polk, Louisiana, and currently serving in Latin America and 
      the Carribean.

      Most importantly I am a christian with four wonderful children, Christopher, Breanna, Alyssa, and Dakota to whom my life is dedicated as 
      Jesus has inspired me to be from one father to another.  I am blessed with one brother and sister, Jon and Laura.  They in turn have 
      their families that make it a more enriched experience.  My parents have parted and I miss them sorely.  I'm no preacher or something to 
      put on a pedestal.  However, after a fall I get up and press forward and always know where to turn to ie Jesus.  At least the devil 
      can't tempt me there with an undeserving attitude.  This is a good snapshot of whom I am and some of my interests.
