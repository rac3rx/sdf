NOTE: This is not a unix newbie installation instruction set. This document is
      primarily for me. It has served me well as a reference aid. I am a unix
      newbie, reciprocating what I have been taught by the unix community and
      that is, having an altruistic spirit. Taking the time to document what I
      have learned and passing it along.

      This is all copied material and is not original it is just a compilation
      from other works ... I stand on the shoulders of giants that proceed me.

      Needs much work very unclear in some parts especially towards the end

Chapter 1:  Network Configuration: Getting down to one keyboard 

Under Netbsd the default shell is csh. It is really useful having "Filename 
Completion" So first we will set setup "Filename Completion".

1.1  .cshrc must be edited

  a.  # vi ./.chshrc 

  b.  add the following line with a comment is good practice,

      set filec       # enabling "Filename Completion"

Second most important thing is to setup the network. I always used
"ifconfig -a" which list all the network devices on the system. This method was
intuitive enough for me. However, I found a more precise method later which
uses grep on dmesg. Infact, the tip I read from somewhere underneath, 
1.2  Network Configuartion-a.-ii. does not work for me. You could substitute
"MAC" with "address" Additionally if dmesg has been flushed the last bootstrap
information is saved under, "/var/run/dmesg.boot".

1.2  Network Configuration
     
  a.  find the nic, 
     i.  # ifconfig -a
     ii.  # dmesg | grep MAC
     iii.  # dmesg | grep address 
     iv.  # grep '.*address.*' /var/run/dmesg.boot

I do not know how to come up with the hexadecimal address down below for the
netmask value. However it has the same value as 255.255.255.0. The
suffix of "/etc/ifconfig.fxp0" is the driver name.

  b.  configure the nic, where "x.x.x.x" is an ip address"
     i.  # echo "x.x.x.x netmask 0xffffff00" > /etc/ifconfig.fxp0
     ii.  # echo "auto_ifconfig=YES" >> /etc/rc.conf
  c.  configure hostname 
     i.  # echo "Gimili.dwarvesmountain.org" > /etc/myname
  d.  configure default gateway
     i.  # echo "x.x.x.x" > /etc/mygate
  e.  configure resolver
     i. # echo "nameserver x.x.x.x" > /etc/resolv.conf
  f.  setup system time
     i. # ntpdate -b tick.uh.edu
  h.  /etc/hosts
  i.  Very important file down below e.g. sshd, ntpdate, named, etc,
      /etc/defaults/rc.conf


1.3  sshd and ssh

  a.  ssh-keygen -t dsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key -N password
    
     i.  null password must be set for system host key
     ii. down below are the locations for the system keyfiles,

       /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key
       /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
       /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key

  b. ssh-keygen -t rsa1
     ssh-keygen -t rsa
  c. HOME/.ssh/authorized_key or HOME/.ssh/authorized_key2
  d. # copy identity.pub, id_rsa.pub and id_dsa.pub 
  e. # cat id_dsa.pub > ./authorized_key2

  d. # vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        
	i. uncomment the following line,
	      
	      #Protocol 2,1

	ii.    edit it to read the following,

	      Protocol 2
   e. kill -1 <process_id> for sshd to reread /etc/ssh/sshd_config

1.4  rc.conf
  a.  /etc/default/rc.conf
  b.  /etc/rc.conf

1.5  Contents of /etc/rc.conf down below will start the sshd. If the last
     three lines are uncommented a pppd gateway will be partially configure.

--begin snip /etc/rc.conf--

#       $NetBSD: rc.conf,v 1.96 2000/10/14 17:01:29 wiz Exp $
#
# see rc.conf(5) for more information.
#
# Use program=YES to enable program, NO to disable it. program_flags are
# passed to the program on the command line.
#

# Load the defaults in from /etc/defaults/rc.conf (if it's readable).
# These can be overridden below.
#
if [ -r /etc/defaults/rc.conf ]; then
        . /etc/defaults/rc.conf
fi

# If this is not set to YES, the system will drop into single-user mode.
#
rc_configured=YES

# Add local overrides below
#
wscons=YES

sshd=YES                sshd_flags=""            # start the ssh daemon

# The next three lines are used for pppd gateway
#
#ppp_peers="Coke"                                # /etc/ppp/peers to call
#ipfilter=YES                                    # uses /etc/ipf.conf
#ipnat=YES                                       # uses /etc/ipnat.conf

--end snip /etc/rc.conf--

# Note: Mutt will not automatically source this file; you must
# explicitly use the ``source'' command for it to be executed.
# 
# 
# set alias_format="%4n %2f %t %-10a   %r"
#
# Name: alias_format
# Type: string
# Default: "%4n %2f %t %-10a   %r"
# 
# 
# Specifies the format of the data displayed for the `alias' menu.  The
# following printf(3)-style sequences are available:
# 
# %a      alias name
# %f      flags - currently, a "d" for an alias marked for deletion
# %n      index number
# %r      address which alias expands to
# %t      character which indicates if the alias is tagged for inclusion
# 
# 
# set allow_8bit=yes
#
# Name: allow_8bit
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# Controls whether 8-bit data is converted to 7-bit using either Quoted-
# Printable or Base64 encoding when sending mail.
# 
# 
# set allow_ansi=no
#
# Name: allow_ansi
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# Controls whether ANSI color codes in messages (and color tags in 
# rich text messages) are to be interpreted.
# Messages containing these codes are rare, but if this option is set,
# their text will be colored accordingly. Note that this may override
# your color choices, and even present a security problem, since a
# message could include a line like "[-- PGP output follows ..." and
# give it the same color as your attachment color.
# 
# 
# set alternates=""
#
# Name: alternates
# Type: regular expression
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# A regexp that allows you to specify alternate addresses where
# you receive mail.  This affects Mutt's idea about messages from you
# and addressed to you.
# 
# 
# set arrow_cursor=no
#
# Name: arrow_cursor
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, an arrow (``->'') will be used to indicate the current entry
# in menus instead of hiliting the whole line.  On slow network or modem
# links this will make response faster because there is less that has to
# be redrawn on the screen when moving to the next or previous entries
# in the menu.
# 
# 
# set ascii_chars=no
#
# Name: ascii_chars
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, Mutt will use plain ASCII characters when displaying thread
# and attachment trees, instead of the default ACS characters.
# 
# 
# set askbcc=no
#
# Name: askbcc
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, Mutt will prompt you for blind-carbon-copy (Bcc) recipients
# before editing an outgoing message.
# 
#

# 
# 
# set attach_sep="\n"
#
# Name: attach_sep
# Type: string
# Default: "\n"
# 
# 
# The separator to add between attachments when operating (saving,
# printing, piping, etc) on a list of tagged attachments.
# 
# 
# set attach_split=yes
#
# Name: attach_split
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If this variable is unset, when operating (saving, printing, piping,
# etc) on a list of tagged attachments, Mutt will concatenate the
# attachments and will operate on them as a single attachment. The
# ``$attach_sep'' separator is added after each attachment. When set,
# Mutt will operate on the attachments one by one.
# 
# 
# set attribution="On %d, %n wrote:"
#
# Name: attribution
# Type: string
# Default: "On %d, %n wrote:"
# 
# 
# This is the string that will precede a message which has been included
# in a reply.  For a full listing of defined printf()-like sequences see
# the section on ``$index_format''.
# 
# 
# set autoedit=no
#
# Name: autoedit
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set along with ``$edit_headers'', Mutt will skip the initial
# send-menu and allow you to immediately begin editing the body of your
# message.  The send-menu may still be accessed once you have finished
# editing the body of your message.
# 
# Also see ``$fast_reply''.
# 
# 
# set auto_tag=no
#
# Name: auto_tag
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, functions in the index menu which affect a message
# will be applied to all tagged messages (if there are any).  When
# unset, you must first use the tag-prefix function (default: ";") to
# make the next function apply to all tagged messages.
# 
# 
# set beep=yes
#
# Name: beep
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When this variable is set, mutt will beep when an error occurs.
# 
# 
# set beep_new=no
#
# Name: beep_new
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When this variable is set, mutt will beep whenever it prints a message
# notifying you of new mail.  This is independent of the setting of the
# ``$beep'' variable.
# 
# 
# set bounce_delivered=yes
#
# Name: bounce_delivered
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When this variable is set, mutt will include Delivered-To headers when
# bouncing messages.  Postfix users may wish to unset this variable.
# 
# 
# set charset=""
#
# Name: charset
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# Character set your terminal uses to display and enter textual data.
# 
# 
# set check_new=yes
#
# Name: check_new
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# Note: this option only affects maildir and MH style
# mailboxes.
# 
# When set, Mutt will check for new mail delivered while the
# mailbox is open.  Especially with MH mailboxes, this operation can
# take quite some time since it involves scanning the directory and
# checking each file to see if it has already been looked at.  If
# check_new is unset, no check for new mail is performed
# while the mailbox is open.
# 
# 
# set collapse_unread=yes
#
# Name: collapse_unread
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When unset, Mutt will not collapse a thread if it contains any
# unread messages.
# 
# 
# set uncollapse_jump=no
#
# Name: uncollapse_jump
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, Mutt will jump to the next unread message, if any,
# when the current thread is uncollapsed.
# 
# 
# set compose_format="-- Mutt: Compose  [Approx. msg size: %l   Atts: %a]%>-"
#
# Name: compose_format
# Type: string
# Default: "-- Mutt: Compose  [Approx. msg size: %l   Atts: %a]%>-"
# 
# 
# Controls the format of the status line displayed in the \fCompose
# menu.  This string is similar to ``$status_format'', but has its own
# set of printf()-like sequences:
# 
# %a      total number of attachments 
# %h      local hostname
# %l      approximate size (in bytes) of the current message
# %v      Mutt version string
# 
# 
# See the text describing the ``$status_format'' option for more 
# information on how to set ``$compose_format''.
# 
# 
# set confirmappend=yes
#
# Name: confirmappend
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, Mutt will prompt for confirmation when appending messages to
# an existing mailbox.
# 
# 
# set confirmcreate=yes
#
# Name: confirmcreate
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, Mutt will prompt for confirmation when saving messages to a
# mailbox which does not yet exist before creating it.
# 
# 
# set connect_timeout=30
#
# Name: connect_timeout
# Type: number
# Default: 30
# 
# 
# Causes Mutt to timeout a network connection (for IMAP or POP) after this
# many seconds if the connection is not able to be established.  A negative
# value causes Mutt to wait indefinitely for the connection to succeed.
# 
# 
 set copy=yes
#
# Name: copy
# Type: quadoption
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# This variable controls whether or not copies of your outgoing messages
# will be saved for later references.  Also see ``$record'',
# ``$save_name'', ``$force_name'' and ``fcc-hook''.
# 
# 
# set date_format="!%a, %b %d, %Y at %I:%M:%S%p %Z"
#
# Name: date_format
# Type: string
# Default: "!%a, %b %d, %Y at %I:%M:%S%p %Z"
# 
# 
# This variable controls the format of the date printed by the ``%d''
# sequence in ``$index_format''.  This is passed to the strftime
# call to process the date. See the man page for strftime(3) for
# the proper syntax.
# 
# Unless the first character in the string is a bang (``!''), the month
# and week day names are expanded according to the locale specified in
# the variable ``$locale''. If the first character in the string is a
# bang, the bang is discarded, and the month and week day names in the
# rest of the string are expanded in the C locale (that is in US
# English).
# 
# 
# set default_hook="~f %s !~P | (~P ~C %s)"
#
# Name: default_hook
# Type: string
# Default: "~f %s !~P | (~P ~C %s)"
# 
# 
# This variable controls how send-hooks, message-hooks, save-hooks,
# and fcc-hooks will
# be interpreted if they are specified with only a simple regexp,
# instead of a matching pattern.  The hooks are expanded when they are
# declared, so a hook will be interpreted according to the value of this
# variable at the time the hook is declared.  The default value matches
# if the message is either from a user matching the regular expression
# given, or if it is from you (if the from address matches
# ``$alternates'') and is to or cc'ed to a user matching the given
# regular expression.
# 
# 
# set delete=ask-yes
#
# Name: delete
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-yes
# 
# 
# Controls whether or not messages are really deleted when closing or
# synchronizing a mailbox.  If set to yes, messages marked for
# deleting will automatically be purged without prompting.  If set to
# no, messages marked for deletion will be kept in the mailbox.
# 
# 
# set delete_untag=yes
#
# Name: delete_untag
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If this option is set, mutt will untag messages when marking them
# for deletion.  This applies when you either explicitly delete a message,
# or when you save it to another folder.
# 
# 
# set digest_collapse=yes
#
# Name: digest_collapse
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If this option is set, mutt's revattach menu will not show the subparts of
# individual messages in a digest.  To see these subparts, press 'v' on that menu.
# 
# 
# set display_filter=""
#
# Name: display_filter
# Type: path
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# When set, specifies a command used to filter messages.  When a message
# is viewed it is passed as standard input to $display_filter, and the
# filtered message is read from the standard output.
# 
# 
# set dsn_notify=""
#
# Name: dsn_notify
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# Note: you should not enable this unless you are using Sendmail
# 8.8.x or greater.
# 
# This variable sets the request for when notification is returned.  The
# string consists of a comma separated list (no spaces!) of one or more
# of the following: never, to never request notification,
# failure, to request notification on transmission failure,
# delay, to be notified of message delays, success, to be
# notified of successful transmission.
# 
# Example: set dsn_notify="failure,delay"
# 
# 
# set dsn_return=""
#
# Name: dsn_return
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# Note: you should not enable this unless you are using Sendmail
# 8.8.x or greater.
# 
# This variable controls how much of your message is returned in DSN
# messages.  It may be set to either hdrs to return just the
# message header, or full to return the full message.
# 
# Example: set dsn_return=hdrs
# 
# 
# set duplicate_threads=yes
#
# Name: duplicate_threads
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# This variable controls whether mutt, when sorting by threads, threads
# messages with the same message-id together.  If it is set, it will indicate
# that it thinks they are duplicates of each other with an equals sign
# in the thread diagram.
# 
# 
 set edit_headers=no
#
# Name: edit_headers
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# This option allows you to edit the header of your outgoing messages
# along with the body of your message.
# 
# 
# set editor=""
#
# Name: editor
# Type: path
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# This variable specifies which editor is used by mutt.
# It defaults to the value of the VISUAL, or EDITOR, environment
# variable, or to the string "vi" if neither of those are set.
# 
# 
# set encode_from=no
#
# Name: encode_from
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will quoted-printable encode messages when
# they contain the string "From " in the beginning of a line.
# Useful to avoid the tampering certain mail delivery and transport
# agents tend to do with messages.
# 
# 
# set envelope_from=no
#
# Name: envelope_from
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will try to derive the message's envelope
# sender from the "From:" header.  Note that this information is passed 
# to sendmail command using the "-f" command line switch, so don't set this
# option if you are using that switch in $sendmail yourself,
# or if the sendmail on your machine doesn't support that command
# line switch.
# 
# 
# set escape="~"
#
# Name: escape
# Type: string
# Default: "~"
# 
# 
# Escape character to use for functions in the builtin editor.
# 
# 
# set fast_reply=no
#
# Name: fast_reply
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, the initial prompt for recipients and subject are skipped
# when replying to messages, and the initial prompt for subject is
# skipped when forwarding messages.
# 
# Note: this variable has no effect when the ``$autoedit''
# variable is set.
# 
# 
# set fcc_attach=yes
#
# Name: fcc_attach
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# This variable controls whether or not attachments on outgoing messages
# are saved along with the main body of your message.
# 
# 
# set fcc_clear=no
#
# Name: fcc_clear
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When this variable is set, FCCs will be stored unencrypted and
# unsigned, even when the actual message is encrypted and/or signed.
# 
# 
 set folder="~/Mail"
 unset force_name

#
# Name: folder
# Type: path
# Default: "~/Mail"
# 
# 
# Specifies the default location of your mailboxes.  A `+' or `=' at the
# beginning of a pathname will be expanded to the value of this
# variable.  Note that if you change this variable from the default
# value you need to make sure that the assignment occurs before
# you use `+' or `=' for any other variables since expansion takes place
# during the `set' command.
# 
# 
# set folder_format="%2C %t %N %F %2l %-8.8u %-8.8g %8s %d %f"
#
# Name: folder_format
# Type: string
# Default: "%2C %t %N %F %2l %-8.8u %-8.8g %8s %d %f"
# 
# 
# This variable allows you to customize the file browser display to your
# personal taste.  This string is similar to ``$index_format'', but has
# its own set of printf()-like sequences:
# 
# %C      current file number
# %d      date/time folder was last modified
# %f      filename
# %F      file permissions
# %g      group name (or numeric gid, if missing)
# %l      number of hard links
# %N      N if folder has new mail, blank otherwise
# %s      size in bytes
# %t      * if the file is tagged, blank otherwise
# %u      owner name (or numeric uid, if missing)
# %>X     right justify the rest of the string and pad with character "X"
# %|X     pad to the end of the line with character "X"
# 
# 
# set followup_to=yes
#
# Name: followup_to
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# Controls whether or not the Mail-Followup-To header field is
# generated when sending mail.  When set, Mutt will generate this
# field when you are replying to a known mailing list, specified with
# the ``subscribe'' or ``lists'' commands.
# 
# This field has two purposes.  First, preventing you from receiving
# duplicate copies of replies to messages which you send to mailing
# lists.  Second, ensuring that you do get a reply separately for any
# messages sent to known lists to which you are not subscribed.  The
# header will contain only the list's address for subscribed lists,
# and both the list address and your own email address for unsubscribed
# lists.  Without this header, a group reply to your message sent to a
# subscribed list will be sent to both the list and your address,
# resulting in two copies of the same email for you.
# 
# 
# set force_name=no
#
# Name: force_name
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# This variable is similar to ``$save_name'', except that Mutt will
# store a copy of your outgoing message by the username of the address
# you are sending to even if that mailbox does not exist.
# 
# Also see the ``$record'' variable.
# 
# 
# set forward_decode=yes
#
# Name: forward_decode
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# Controls the decoding of complex MIME messages into text/plain when
# forwarding a message.  The message header is also RFC2047 decoded.
# This variable is only used, if ``$mime_forward'' is unset,
# otherwise ``$mime_forward_decode'' is used instead.
# 
# 
# set forward_format="[%a: %s]"
#
# Name: forward_format
# Type: string
# Default: "[%a: %s]"
# 
# 
# This variable controls the default subject when forwarding a message.
# It uses the same format sequences as the ``$index_format'' variable.
# 
# 
# set forward_quote=no
#
# Name: forward_quote
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set forwarded messages included in the main body of the
# message (when ``$mime_forward'' is unset) will be quoted using
# ``$indent_string''.
# 
# 
# set from=""
#
# Name: from
# Type: e-mail address
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# When set, this variable contains a default from address.  It
# can be overridden using my_hdr (including from send-hooks) and
# ``$reverse_name''.
# 
# Defaults to the EMAIL environment variable's content.
# 
# 
# set gecos_mask="^[^,]*"
#
# Name: gecos_mask
# Type: regular expression
# Default: "^[^,]*"
# 
# 
# A regular expression used by mutt to parse the GECOS field of a password
# entry when expanding the alias.  By default the regular expression is set
# to "^[^,]*" which will return the string up to the first "," encountered.
# If the GECOS field contains a string like "lastname, firstname" then you
# should set the gecos_mask=".*".
# 
# This can be useful if you see the following behavior: you address a e-mail
# to user ID stevef whose full name is Steve Franklin.  If mutt expands 
# stevef to "Franklin" stevef@foo.bar then you should set the gecos_mask to
# a regular expression that will match the whole name so mutt will expand
# "Franklin" to "Franklin, Steve".
# 
# 
# set hdrs=yes
#
# Name: hdrs
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When unset, the header fields normally added by the ``my_hdr''
# command are not created.  This variable must be unset before
# composing a new message or replying in order to take effect.  If set,
# the user defined header fields are added to every new message.
# 
# 
# set header=no
#
# Name: header
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, this variable causes Mutt to include the header
# of the message you are replying to into the edit buffer.
# The ``$weed'' setting applies.
# 
# 
# set help=yes
#
# Name: help
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, help lines describing the bindings for the major functions
# provided by each menu are displayed on the first line of the screen.
# 
# Note: The binding will not be displayed correctly if the
# function is bound to a sequence rather than a single keystroke.  Also,
# the help line may not be updated if a binding is changed while Mutt is
# running.  Since this variable is primarily aimed at new users, neither
# of these should present a major problem.
# 
# 
# set hidden_host=no
#
# Name: hidden_host
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will skip the host name part of ``$hostname'' variable
# when adding the domain part to addresses.  This variable does not
# affect the generation of Message-IDs, and it will not lead to the 
# cut-off of first-level domains.
# 
# 
# set hide_limited=no
#
# Name: hide_limited
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will not show the presence of missing messages in the
# thread tree.
# 
# 
# set hide_missing=yes
#
# Name: hide_missing
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will not show the presence of messages that are hidden
# by limiting, in the thread tree.
# 
# 
# set hide_top_limited=no
#
# Name: hide_top_limited
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will not show the presence of missing messages at the
# top of threads in the thread tree.  Note that when $hide_limited is
# set, this option will have no effect.
# 
# 
# set hide_top_missing=yes
#
# Name: hide_top_missing
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will not show the presence of messages that are hidden
# by limiting, at the top of threads in the thread tree.Note that when
# $hide_missing is set, this option will have no effect.
# 
# 
# set history=10
#
# Name: history
# Type: number
# Default: 10
# 
# 
# This variable controls the size (in number of strings remembered) of
# the string history buffer. The buffer is cleared each time the
# variable is set.
# 
# 
# set honor_followup_to=yes
#
# Name: honor_followup_to
# Type: quadoption
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# This variable controls whether or not a Mail-Followup-To header is
# honored when group-replying to a message.
# 
# 
# set hostname=""
#
# Name: hostname
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# Specifies the hostname to use after the ``@'' in local e-mail
# addresses.  This overrides the compile time definition obtained from
# /etc/resolv.conf.
# 
# 
# set ignore_list_reply_to=no
#
# Name: ignore_list_reply_to
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# Affects the behaviour of the reply function when replying to
# messages from mailing lists.  When set, if the ``Reply-To:'' field is
# set to the same value as the ``To:'' field, Mutt assumes that the
# ``Reply-To:'' field was set by the mailing list to automate responses
# to the list, and will ignore this field.  To direct a response to the
# mailing list when this option is set, use the list-reply
# function; group-reply will reply to both the sender and the
# list.
# 
# 
# set imap_authenticators=""
#
# Name: imap_authenticators
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# This is a colon-delimited list of authentication methods mutt may
# attempt to use to log in to an IMAP server, in the order mutt should
# try them.  Authentication methods are either 'login' or the right
# side of an IMAP 'AUTH=xxx' capability string, eg 'digest-md5',
# 'gssapi' or 'cram-md5'. This parameter is case-insensitive. If this
# parameter is unset (the default) mutt will try all available methods,
# in order from most-secure to least-secure.
# 
# Example: set imap_authenticators="gssapi:cram-md5:login"
# 
# Note: Mutt will only fall back to other authentication methods if
# the previous methods are unavailable. If a method is available but
# authentication fails, mutt will not connect to the IMAP server.
# 
# 
# set imap_delim_chars="/."
#
# Name: imap_delim_chars
# Type: string
# Default: "/."
# 
# 
# This contains the list of characters which you would like to treat
# as folder separators for displaying IMAP paths. In particular it
# helps in using the '=' shortcut for your folder variable.
# 
# 
# set imap_force_ssl=no
#
# Name: imap_force_ssl
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If this variable is set, Mutt will always use SSL when
# connecting to IMAP servers.
# 
# 
# set imap_home_namespace=""
#
# Name: imap_home_namespace
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# You normally want to see your personal folders alongside
# your INBOX in the IMAP browser. If you see something else, you may set
# this variable to the IMAP path to your folders.
# 
# 
# set imap_keepalive=900
#
# Name: imap_keepalive
# Type: number
# Default: 900
# 
# 
# This variable specifies the maximum amount of time in seconds that mutt
# will wait before polling open IMAP connections, to prevent the server
# from closing them before mutt has finished with them. The default is
# well within the RFC-specified minimum amount of time (30 minutes) before
# a server is allowed to do this, but in practice the RFC does get
# violated every now and then. Reduce this number if you find yourself
# getting disconnected from your IMAP server due to inactivity.
# 
# 
# set imap_list_subscribed=no
#
# Name: imap_list_subscribed
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# This variable configures whether IMAP folder browsing will look for
# only subscribed folders or all folders.  This can be toggled in the
# IMAP browser with the toggle-subscribed function.
# 
# 
# set imap_pass=""
#
# Name: imap_pass
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# Specifies the password for your IMAP account.  If unset, Mutt will
# prompt you for your password when you invoke the fetch-mail function.
# Warning: you should only use this option when you are on a
# fairly secure machine, because the superuser can read your muttrc even
# if you are the only one who can read the file.
# 
# 
# set imap_passive=yes
#
# Name: imap_passive
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will not open new IMAP connections to check for new
# mail.  Mutt will only check for new mail over existing IMAP
# connections.  This is useful if you don't want to be prompted to
# user/password pairs on mutt invocation, or if opening the connection
# is slow.
# 
# 
# set imap_peek=yes
#
# Name: imap_peek
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If set, mutt will avoid implicitly marking your mail as read whenever
# you fetch a message from the server. This is generally a good thing,
# but can make closing an IMAP folder somewhat slower. This option
# exists to appease speed freaks.
# 
# 
# set imap_servernoise=yes
#
# Name: imap_servernoise
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will display warning messages from the IMAP
# server as error messages. Since these messages are often
# harmless, or generated due to configuration problems on the
# server which are out of the users' hands, you may wish to suppress
# them at some point.
# 
# 
# set imap_user=""
#
# Name: imap_user
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# Your login name on the IMAP server.
# 
# This variable defaults to your user name on the local machine.
# 
# 
# set implicit_autoview=no
#
# Name: implicit_autoview
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set to ``yes'', mutt will look for a mailcap entry with the
# copiousoutput flag set for every MIME attachment it doesn't have
# an internal viewer defined for.  If such an entry is found, mutt will
# use the viewer defined in that entry to convert the body part to text
# form.
# 
# 
# set include=ask-yes
#
# Name: include
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-yes
# 
# 
# Controls whether or not a copy of the message(s) you are replying to
# is included in your reply.
# 
# 
# set indent_string="> "
#
# Name: indent_string
# Type: string
# Default: "> "
# 
# 
# Specifies the string to prepend to each line of text quoted in a
# message to which you are replying.  You are strongly encouraged not to
# change this value, as it tends to agitate the more fanatical netizens.
# 
# 
# set index_format="%4C %Z %{%b %d} %-15.15L (%4l) %s"
#
# Name: index_format
# Type: string
# Default: "%4C %Z %{%b %d} %-15.15L (%4l) %s"
# 
# 
# This variable allows you to customize the message index display to
# your personal taste.
# 
# ``Format strings'' are similar to the strings used in the ``C''
# function printf to format output (see the man page for more detail).
# The following sequences are defined in Mutt:
# 
# %a      address of the author
# %b      filename of the original message folder (think mailBox)
# %B      the list to which the letter was sent, or else the folder name (%b).

# 
# set ispell="ispell"
#
# Name: ispell
# Type: path
# Default: "ispell"
# 
# 
# How to invoke ispell (GNU's spell-checking software).
# 
# 
# set keep_flagged=no
#
# Name: keep_flagged
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, read messages marked as flagged will not be moved
# from your spool mailbox to your ``$mbox'' mailbox, or as a result of
# a ``mbox-hook'' command.
# 
# 
# set locale="C"
#
# Name: locale
# Type: string
# Default: "C"
# 
# 
# The locale used by strftime(3) to format dates. Legal values are
# the strings your system accepts for the locale variable LC_TIME.
# 
# 
# set mail_check=5
#
# Name: mail_check
# Type: number
# Default: 5
# 
# 
# This variable configures how often (in seconds) mutt should look for
# new mail.
# 
# 
# set mailcap_path=""
#
# Name: mailcap_path
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# This variable specifies which files to consult when attempting to
# display MIME bodies not directly supported by Mutt.
# 
# 
# set mailcap_sanitize=yes
#
# Name: mailcap_sanitize
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If set, mutt will restrict possible characters in mailcap % expandos
# to a well-defined set of safe characters.  This is the safe setting,
# but we are not sure it doesn't break some more advanced MIME stuff.
# 
# DON'T CHANGE THIS SETTING UNLESS YOU ARE REALLY SURE WHAT YOU ARE
# DOING!
# 
# 
# set maildir_trash=no
#
# Name: maildir_trash
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, messages marked as deleted will be saved with the maildir
# (T)rashed flag instead of unlinked.  NOTE: this only applies
# to maildir-style mailboxes.  Setting it will have no effect on other
# mailbox types.
# 
# 
# set mark_old=yes
#
# Name: mark_old
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# Controls whether or not Mutt makes the distinction between new
# messages and old unread messages.  By default, Mutt will
# mark new messages as old if you exit a mailbox without reading them.
# The next time you start Mutt, the messages will show up with an "O"
# next to them in the index menu, indicating that they are old.  In
# order to make Mutt treat all unread messages as new only, you can
# unset this variable.
# 
# 
# set markers=yes
#
# Name: markers
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# Controls the display of wrapped lines in the internal pager. If set, a
# ``+'' marker is displayed at the beginning of wrapped lines. Also see
# the ``$smart_wrap'' variable.
# 
# 
# set mask="!^\\.[^.]"
#
# Name: mask
# Type: regular expression
# Default: "!^\\.[^.]"
# 
# 
# A regular expression used in the file browser, optionally preceded by
# the not operator ``!''.  Only files whose names match this mask
# will be shown. The match is always case-sensitive.
# 
# 
# set mbox="~/mbox"
  set mbox="~/Mail/incoming"

#
# Name: mbox
# Type: path
# Default: "~/mbox"
# 
# 
# This specifies the folder into which read mail in your ``$spoolfile''
# folder will be appended.
# 
# 
# set mbox_type=mbox
#
# Name: mbox_type
# Type: folder magic
# Default: mbox
# 
# 
# The default mailbox type used when creating new folders. May be any of
# mbox, MMDF, MH and Maildir.
# 
# 
# set metoo=no
#
# Name: metoo
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If unset, Mutt will remove your address (see the ``$alternates''
# variable) from the list of recipients when replying to a message.
# 
# 
# set menu_scroll=no
#
# Name: menu_scroll
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, menus will be scrolled up or down one line when you
# attempt to move across a screen boundary.  If unset, the screen
# is cleared and the next or previous page of the menu is displayed
# (useful for slow links to avoid many redraws).
# 
# 
# set meta_key=no
#
# Name: meta_key
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, forces Mutt to interpret keystrokes with the high bit (bit 8)
# set as if the user had pressed the ESC key and whatever key remains
# after having the high bit removed.  For example, if the key pressed
# has an ASCII value of 0xf4, then this is treated as if the user had
# pressed ESC then ``x''.  This is because the result of removing the
# high bit from ``0xf4'' is ``0x74'', which is the ASCII character
# ``x''.
# 
# 
# set mh_purge=no
#
# Name: mh_purge
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When unset, mutt will mimic mh's behaviour and rename deleted messages
# to ,<old file name> in mh folders instead of really deleting
# them.  If the variable is set, the message files will simply be
# deleted.
# 
# 
# set mh_seq_flagged="flagged"
#
# Name: mh_seq_flagged
# Type: string
# Default: "flagged"
# 
# 
# The name of the MH sequence used for flagged messages.
# 
# 
# set mh_seq_replied="replied"
#
# Name: mh_seq_replied
# Type: string
# Default: "replied"
# 
# 
# The name of the MH sequence used to tag replied messages.
# 
# 
# set mh_seq_unseen="unseen"
#
# Name: mh_seq_unseen
# Type: string
# Default: "unseen"
# 
# 
# The name of the MH sequence used for unseen messages.
# 
# 
# set mime_forward=no
#
# Name: mime_forward
# Type: quadoption
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, the message you are forwarding will be attached as a
# separate MIME part instead of included in the main body of the
# message.  This is useful for forwarding MIME messages so the receiver
# can properly view the message as it was delivered to you. If you like
# to switch between MIME and not MIME from mail to mail, set this
# variable to ask-no or ask-yes.
# 
# Also see ``$forward_decode'' and ``$mime_forward_decode''.
# 
# 
# set mime_forward_decode=no
#
# Name: mime_forward_decode
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# Controls the decoding of complex MIME messages into text/plain when
# forwarding a message while ``$mime_forward'' is set. Otherwise
# ``$forward_decode'' is used instead.
# 
# 
# set mime_forward_rest=yes
#
# Name: mime_forward_rest
# Type: quadoption
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When forwarding multiple attachments of a MIME message from the recvattach
# menu, attachments which cannot be decoded in a reasonable manner will
# be attached to the newly composed message if this option is set.
# 
# 
# set mix_entry_format="%4n %c %-16s %a"
#
# Name: mix_entry_format
# Type: string
# Default: "%4n %c %-16s %a"
# 
# 
# This variable describes the format of a remailer line on the mixmaster
# chain selection screen.  The following printf-like sequences are 
# supported:
# 
# %n      The running number on the menu.
# %c      Remailer capabilities.
# %s      The remailer's short name.
# %a      The remailer's e-mail address.
# 
# 
# set mixmaster="mixmaster"
#
# Name: mixmaster
# Type: path
# Default: "mixmaster"
# 
# 
# This variable contains the path to the Mixmaster binary on your
# system.  It is used with various sets of parameters to gather the
# list of known remailers, and to finally send a message through the
# mixmaster chain.
# 
# 
# set move=ask-no
#
# Name: move
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-no
# 
# 
# Controls whether you will be asked to confirm moving read messages
# from your spool mailbox to your ``$mbox'' mailbox, or as a result of
# a ``mbox-hook'' command.
# 
# 
# set message_format="%s"
#
# Name: message_format
# Type: string
# Default: "%s"
# 
# 
# This is the string displayed in the ``attachment'' menu for
# attachments of type message/rfc822.  For a full listing of defined
# printf()-like sequences see the section on ``$index_format''.
# 
# 
# set pager="builtin"
#
# Name: pager
# Type: path
# Default: "builtin"
# 
# 
# This variable specifies which pager you would like to use to view
# messages.  builtin means to use the builtin pager, otherwise this
# variable should specify the pathname of the external pager you would
# like to use.
# 
# Using an external pager may have some disadvantages: Additional
# keystrokes are necessary because you can't call mutt functions
# directly from the pager, and screen resizes cause lines longer than
# the screen width to be badly formatted in the help menu.
# 
# 
# set pager_context=0
#
# Name: pager_context
# Type: number
# Default: 0
# 
# 
# This variable controls the number of lines of context that are given
# when displaying the next or previous page in the internal pager.  By
# default, Mutt will display the line after the last one on the screen
# at the top of the next page (0 lines of context).
# 
# 
# set pager_format="-%Z- %C/%m: %-20.20n   %s"
#
# Name: pager_format
# Type: string
# Default: "-%Z- %C/%m: %-20.20n   %s"
# 
# 
# This variable controls the format of the one-line message ``status''
# displayed before each message in either the internal or an external
# pager.  The valid sequences are listed in the ``$index_format''
# section.
# 
# 
# set pager_index_lines=0
#
# Name: pager_index_lines
# Type: number
# Default: 0
# 
# 
# Determines the number of lines of a mini-index which is shown when in
# the pager.  The current message, unless near the top or bottom of the
# folder, will be roughly one third of the way down this mini-index,
# giving the reader the context of a few messages before and after the
# message.  This is useful, for example, to determine how many messages
# remain to be read in the current thread.  One of the lines is reserved
# for the status bar from the index, so a pager_index_lines of 6
# will only show 5 lines of the actual index.  A value of 0 results in
# no index being shown.  If the number of messages in the current folder
# is less than pager_index_lines, then the index will only use as
# many lines as it needs.
# 
# 
# set pager_stop=no
#
# Name: pager_stop
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, the internal-pager will not move to the next message
# when you are at the end of a message and invoke the next-page
# function.
# 
# 
# set pgp_autosign=no
#
# Name: pgp_autosign
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# Setting this variable will cause Mutt to always attempt to PGP/MIME
# sign outgoing messages.  This can be overridden by use of the pgp-
# menu, when signing is not required or encryption is requested as
# well.
# 
# 
# set pgp_autoencrypt=no
#
# Name: pgp_autoencrypt
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# Setting this variable will cause Mutt to always attempt to PGP/MIME
# encrypt outgoing messages.  This is probably only useful in connection
# to the send-hook command.  It can be overridden by use of the
# pgp-menu, when encryption is not required or signing is
# requested as well.
# 
# 
# set pgp_ignore_subkeys=yes
#
# Name: pgp_ignore_subkeys
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# Setting this variable will cause Mutt to ignore OpenPGP subkeys. Instead,
# the principal key will inherit the subkeys' capabilities.  Unset this
# if you want to play interesting key selection games.
# 
# 
# set pgp_entry_format="%4n %t%f %4l/0x%k %-4a %2c %u"
#
# Name: pgp_entry_format
# Type: string
# Default: "%4n %t%f %4l/0x%k %-4a %2c %u"
# 
# 
# This variable allows you to customize the PGP key selection menu to
# your personal taste. This string is similar to ``$index_format'', but
# has its own set of printf()-like sequences:
# 
# %n      number
# %k      key id
# %u      user id
# %a      algorithm
# %l      key length
# %f      flags
# %c      capabilities
# %t      trust/validity of the key-uid association
# %[<s>]  date of the key where <s> is an strftime(3) expression
# 
# 
# set pgp_good_sign=""
#
# Name: pgp_good_sign
# Type: regular expression
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# If you assign a text to this variable, then a PGP signature is only
# considered verified if the output from $pgp_verify_command contains
# the text. Use this variable if the exit code from the command is 0
# even for bad signatures.
# 
# 
# set pgp_long_ids=no
#
# Name: pgp_long_ids
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, use 64 bit PGP key IDs. Unset uses the normal 32 bit Key IDs.
# 
# 
# set pgp_replyencrypt=yes
#
# Name: pgp_replyencrypt
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If set, automatically PGP encrypt replies to messages which are
# encrypted.
# 
# 
# set pgp_replysign=no
#
# Name: pgp_replysign
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, automatically PGP sign replies to messages which are signed.
# 
# Note: this does not work on messages that are encrypted
# and signed!
# 
# 
# set pgp_replysignencrypted=no
#
# Name: pgp_replysignencrypted
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, automatically PGP sign replies to messages which are
# encrypted. This makes sense in combination with
# ``$pgp_replyencrypt'', because it allows you to sign all messages
# which are automatically encrypted.  This works around the problem
# noted in ``$pgp_replysign'', that mutt is not able to find out
# whether an encrypted message is also signed.
# 
# 
# set pgp_retainable_sigs=no
#
# Name: pgp_retainable_sigs
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, signed and encrypted messages will consist of nested
# multipart/signed and multipart/encrypted body parts.
# 
# This is useful for applications like encrypted and signed mailing
# lists, where the outer layer (multipart/encrypted) can be easily
# removed, while the inner multipart/signed part is retained.
# 
# 
# set pgp_show_unusable=yes
#
# Name: pgp_show_unusable
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If set, mutt will display non-usable keys on the PGP key selection
# menu.  This includes keys which have been revoked, have expired, or
# have been marked as ``disabled'' by the user.
# 
# 
# set pgp_sign_as=""
#
# Name: pgp_sign_as
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# If you have more than one key pair, this option allows you to specify
# which of your private keys to use.  It is recommended that you use the

# 
# 
# set pgp_strict_enc=yes
#
# Name: pgp_strict_enc
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If set, Mutt will automatically encode PGP/MIME signed messages as
# quoted-printable.  Please note that unsetting this variable may
# lead to problems with non-verifyable PGP signatures, so only change
# this if you know what you are doing.
# 
# 
# set pgp_timeout=300
#
# Name: pgp_timeout
# Type: number

# set pgp_verify_sig=yes
#
# Name: pgp_verify_sig
# Type: quadoption
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If ``yes'', always attempt to verify PGP/MIME signatures.  If ``ask-yes''

# 
# 
# set pgp_sort_keys=address
#
# Name: pgp_sort_keys
# Type: sort order
# Default: address

# 
# 
# set pgp_create_traditional=no
#
# Name: pgp_create_traditional
# Type: quadoption
# Default: no
# 
# 
# This option controls whether Mutt generates old-style PGP encrypted
# or signed messages under certain circumstances.
# 
# Note that PGP/MIME will be used automatically for messages which have
# a character set different from us-ascii, or which consist of more than

#         string otherwise. Note: This may be used with a %? construct.
# %f      Expands to the name of a file containing a message.
# %s      Expands to the name of a file containing the signature part
#                    of a multipart/signed attachment when verifying it.
# %a      The value of $pgp_sign_as.
# %r      One or more key IDs.

# 
# 
# set pipe_decode=no
#
# Name: pipe_decode
# Type: boolean
# Default: no

# 
# 
# set pop_auth_try_all=yes
#
# Name: pop_auth_try_all
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If set, Mutt will try all available methods. When unset, Mutt will

# 
# 
# set pop_delete=ask-no
#
# Name: pop_delete
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-no
# 
# 
# If set, Mutt will delete successfully downloaded messages from the POP

# download messages but also leave them on the POP server.
# 
# 
# set pop_host=""
#
# Name: pop_host
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# The name of your POP server for the fetch-mail function.  You

# for retrieving only unread messages from the POP server when using
# the fetch-mail function.
# 
# 
# set pop_reconnect=ask-yes
#
# Name: pop_reconnect
# Type: quadoption

# 
# Your login name on the POP server.
# 
# This variable defaults to your user name on the local machine.
# 
# 
# set pop_pass=""
#
# Name: pop_pass
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# Specifies the password for your POP account.  If unset, Mutt will
# prompt you for your password when you open POP mailbox.
# Warning: you should only use this option when you are on a
# fairly secure machine, because the superuser can read your muttrc
# even if you are the only one who can read the file.
# 
# 
# set post_indent_string=""
#
# Name: post_indent_string
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# Similar to the ``$attribution'' variable, Mutt will append this
# string after the inclusion of a message which is being replied to.
# 
# 
# set postpone=ask-yes
#
# Name: postpone
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-yes
# 
# 
# Controls whether or not messages are saved in the ``$postponed''
# mailbox when you elect not to send immediately.
# 
# 
# set postponed="~/postponed"
#
# Name: postponed
# Type: path
# Default: "~/postponed"
# 
# 
# Mutt allows you to indefinitely ``postpone sending a message'' which
# you are editing.  When you choose to postpone a message, Mutt saves it
# in the mailbox specified by this variable.  Also see the ``$postpone''
# variable.
# 
# 
# set preconnect=""
#
# Name: preconnect
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# If set, a shell command to be executed if mutt fails to establish
# a connection to the server. This is useful for setting up secure
# connections, e.g. with ssh(1). If the command returns a  nonzero
# status, mutt gives up opening the server. Example:
# 
# preconnect="ssh -f -q -L 1234:mailhost.net:143 mailhost.net
# sleep 20 < /dev/null > /dev/null"
# 
# Mailbox 'foo' on mailhost.net can now be reached
# as '{localhost:1234}foo'.
# 
# NOTE: For this example to work, you must be able to log in to the
# remote machine without having to enter a password.
# 
# 
# set print=ask-no
#
# Name: print
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-no
#

# This is useful for people (like me) who accidentally hit ``p'' often.
# 
# 
# set print_command="lpr"
#
# Name: print_command
# Type: path
# Default: "lpr"
# 
# 
# This specifies the command pipe that should be used to print messages.
# 
# 
# set print_decode=yes
#
# Name: print_decode
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# Used in connection with the print-message command.  If this
# option is set, the message is decoded before it is passed to the
# external command specified by $print_command.  If this option
# is unset, no processing will be applied to the message when
# printing it.  The latter setting may be useful if you are using
# some advanced printer filter which is able to properly format
# e-mail messages for printing.
# 
# 
# set print_split=no
#
# Name: print_split
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# Used in connection with the print-message command.  If this option
# is set, the command sepcified by $print_command is executed once for
# each message which is to be printed.  If this option is unset, 
# the command specified by $print_command is executed only once, and
# all the messages are concatenated, with a form feed as the message
# separator.
# 
# Those who use the enscript(1) program's mail-printing mode will
# most likely want to set this option.
# 
# 
# set prompt_after=yes
#
# Name: prompt_after
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If you use an external ``$pager'', setting this variable will
# cause Mutt to prompt you for a command when the pager exits rather
# than returning to the index menu.  If unset, Mutt will return to the
# index menu when the external pager exits.
# 
# 
# set query_command=""
#
# Name: query_command
# Type: path
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# This specifies the command that mutt will use to make external address
# queries.  The string should contain a %s, which will be substituted
# with the query string the user types.  See ``query'' for more
# information.
# 
# 
# set quit=yes
#
# Name: quit
# Type: quadoption
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# This variable controls whether ``quit'' and ``exit'' actually quit
# from mutt.  If it set to yes, they do quit, if it is set to no, they
# have no effect, and if it is set to ask-yes or ask-no, you are
# prompted for confirmation when you try to quit.
# 
# 
# set quote_regexp="^([ \t]*[|>:}#])+"
#
# Name: quote_regexp
# Type: regular expression
# Default: "^([ \t]*[|>:}#])+"
# 
# 
# A regular expression used in the internal-pager to determine quoted
# sections of text in the body of a message.
# 
# Note: In order to use the quotedx patterns in the
# internal pager, you need to set this to a regular expression that
# matches exactly the quote characters at the beginning of quoted
# lines.
# 
# 
# set read_inc=10
#
# Name: read_inc
# Type: number
# Default: 10
# 
# 
# If set to a value greater than 0, Mutt will display which message it
# is currently on when reading a mailbox.  The message is printed after
# read_inc messages have been read (e.g., if set to 25, Mutt will
# print a message when it reads message 25, and then again when it gets
# to message 50).  This variable is meant to indicate progress when
# reading large mailboxes which may take some time.
# When set to 0, only a single message will appear before the reading
# the mailbox.
# 
# Also see the ``$write_inc'' variable.
# 
# 
# set read_only=no
#
# Name: read_only
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, all folders are opened in read-only mode.
# 
# 
# set realname=""
#
# Name: realname
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# This variable specifies what "real" or "personal" name should be used
# when sending messages.
# 
# By default, this is the GCOS field from /etc/passwd.  Note that this
# variable will not be used when the user has set a real name
# in the $from variable.
# 
# 
# set recall=ask-yes
#
# Name: recall
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-yes
# 
# 
# Controls whether or not you are prompted to recall postponed messages
# when composing a new message.  Also see ``$postponed''.
# 
# Setting this variable to ``yes'' is not generally useful, and thus not
# recommended.

# Name: record
# Type: path
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# This specifies the file into which your outgoing messages should be

# your messages, but another way to do this is using the ``my_hdr''
# command to create a Bcc: field with your email address in it.)
# 
# The value of $record is overridden by the ``$force_name'' and

#
# Name: reply_regexp
# Type: regular expression
# Default: "^(re([\\[0-9\\]+])*|aw):[ \t]*"
# 
# 
# A regular expression used to recognize reply messages when threading
# and replying. The default value corresponds to the English "Re:" and
# the German "Aw:".
# 
# 
# set reply_self=no
#
# Name: reply_self
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If unset and you are replying to a message sent by you, Mutt will
# assume that you want to reply to the recipients of that message rather
# than to yourself.
# 
# 
# set reply_to=ask-yes
#
# Name: reply_to
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-yes
# 
# 
# If set, Mutt will ask you if you want to use the address listed in the
# Reply-To: header field when replying to a message.  If you answer no,
# it will use the address in the From: header field instead.  This
# option is useful for reading a mailing list that sets the Reply-To:
# header field to the list address and you want to send a private
# message to the author of a message.
# 
# 
# set resolve=yes
#
# Name: resolve
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, the cursor will be automatically advanced to the next
# (possibly undeleted) message whenever a command that modifies the
# current message is executed.
# 
# 
# set reverse_alias=no
#
# Name: reverse_alias
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# This variable controls whether or not Mutt will display the "personal"
# name from your aliases in the index menu if it finds an alias that
# matches the message's sender.  For example, if you have the following
# alias:
# 
# alias juser abd30425@somewhere.net (Joe User)
alias racerx Hammond, Christopher J.
# 
# and then you receive mail which contains the following header:
# 
# From: abd30425@somewhere.net
# 
# It would be displayed in the index menu as ``Joe User'' instead of
# ``abd30425@somewhere.net.''  This is useful when the person's e-mail
# address is not human friendly (like CompuServe addresses).
# 
# 
# set reverse_name=no
#
# Name: reverse_name
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# It may sometimes arrive that you receive mail to a certain machine,
# move the messages to another machine, and reply to some the messages
# from there.  If this variable is set, the default From: line of
# the reply messages is built using the address where you received the
# messages you are replying to.  If the variable is unset, the
# From: line will use your address on the current machine.
# 
# 
# set reverse_realname=yes
#
# Name: reverse_realname
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# This variable fine-tunes the behaviour of the reverse_name feature.
# When it is set, mutt will use the address from incoming messages as-is,
# possibly including eventual real names.  When it is unset, mutt will
# override any such realnames with the setting of the realname variable.
# 
# 
# set rfc2047_parameters=no
#
# Name: rfc2047_parameters
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When this variable is set, Mutt will decode RFC-2047-encoded MIME 
# parameters. You want to set this variable when mutt suggests you
# to save attachments to files named like this: 
# =?iso-8859-1?Q?file=5F=E4=5F991116=2Ezip?=
# 
# When this variable is set interactively, the change doesn't have
# the desired effect before you have changed folders.
# 
# Note that this use of RFC 2047's encoding is explicitly,
# prohibited by the standard, but nevertheless encountered in the
# wild.
# Also note that setting this parameter will not have the effect 
# that mutt generates this kind of encoding.  Instead, mutt will
# unconditionally use the encoding specified in RFC 2231.
# 
# 
# set save_address=no
#
# Name: save_address
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, mutt will take the sender's full address when choosing a
# default folder for saving a mail. If ``$save_name'' or ``$force_name''
# is set too, the selection of the fcc folder will be changed as well.
# 
# 
# set save_empty=yes
#
# Name: save_empty
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When unset, mailboxes which contain no saved messages will be removed
# when closed (the exception is ``$spoolfile'' which is never removed).
# If set, mailboxes are never removed.
# 
# Note: This only applies to mbox and MMDF folders, Mutt does not
# delete MH and Maildir directories.
# 
# 
# set save_name=no
#
# Name: save_name
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# This variable controls how copies of outgoing messages are saved.
# When set, a check is made to see if a mailbox specified by the
# recipient address exists (this is done by searching for a mailbox in
# the ``$folder'' directory with the username part of the
# recipient address).  If the mailbox exists, the outgoing message will
# be saved to that mailbox, otherwise the message is saved to the
# ``$record'' mailbox.
# 
# Also see the ``$force_name'' variable.
# 
# 
# set score=yes
#
# Name: score
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When this variable is unset, scoring is turned off.  This can
# be useful to selectively disable scoring for certain folders when the
# ``$score_threshold_delete'' variable and friends are used.
# 
# 
# set score_threshold_delete=-1
#
# Name: score_threshold_delete
# Type: number
# Default: -1
# 
# 
# Messages which have been assigned a score equal to or lower than the value
# of this variable are automatically marked for deletion by mutt.  Since
# mutt scores are always greater than or equal to zero, the default setting
# of this variable will never mark a message for deletion.
# 
# 
# set score_threshold_flag=9999
#
# Name: score_threshold_flag
# Type: number
# Default: 9999
# 
# 
# Messages wich have been assigned a score greater than or equal to this 
# variable's value are automatically marked "flagged".
# 
# 
# set score_threshold_read=-1
#
# Name: score_threshold_read
# Type: number
# Default: -1
# 
# 
# Messages which have been assigned a score equal to or lower than the value
# of this variable are automatically marked as read by mutt.  Since
# mutt scores are always greater than or equal to zero, the default setting
# of this variable will never mark a message read.
# 
# 
# set send_charset="us-ascii:iso-8859-1:utf-8"
#
# Name: send_charset
# Type: string
# Default: "us-ascii:iso-8859-1:utf-8"
# 
# 
# A list of character sets for outgoing messages. Mutt will use the
# first character set into which the text can be converted exactly.
# If your ``$charset'' is not iso-8859-1 and recipients may not
# understand UTF-8, it is advisable to include in the list an
# appropriate widely used standard character set (such as
# iso-8859-2, koi8-r or iso-2022-jp) either instead of or after
# "iso-8859-1".
# 
# 
# set sendmail="/usr/sbin/sendmail -oem -oi"
#
# Name: sendmail
# Type: path
# Default: "/usr/sbin/sendmail -oem -oi"
# 
# 
# Specifies the program and arguments used to deliver mail sent by Mutt.
# Mutt expects that the specified program interprets additional
# arguments as recipient addresses.
# 
# 
# set sendmail_wait=0
#
# Name: sendmail_wait
# Type: number
# Default: 0
# 
# 
# Specifies the number of seconds to wait for the ``$sendmail'' process
# to finish before giving up and putting delivery in the background.
# 
# Mutt interprets the value of this variable as follows:
# >0      number of seconds to wait for sendmail to finish before continuing
# 0       wait forever for sendmail to finish
# <0      always put sendmail in the background without waiting
# 
# 
# Note that if you specify a value other than 0, the output of the child
# process will be put in a temporary file.  If there is some error, you
# will be informed as to where to find the output.
# 
# 
# set shell=""
#
# Name: shell
# Type: path
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# Command to use when spawning a subshell.  By default, the user's login
# shell from /etc/passwd is used.
# 
# 
# set sig_dashes=yes
#
# Name: sig_dashes
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# If set, a line containing ``-- '' will be inserted before your
# ``$signature''.  It is strongly recommended that you not unset
# this variable unless your ``signature'' contains just your name.  The
# reason for this is because many software packages use ``-- \n'' to
# detect your signature.  For example, Mutt has the ability to highlight
# the signature in a different color in the builtin pager.
# 
# 
# set sig_on_top=no
#
# Name: sig_on_top
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, the signature will be included before any quoted or forwarded
# text.  It is strongly recommended that you do not set this variable
# unless you really know what you are doing, and are prepared to take
# some heat from netiquette guardians.
# 
# 
# set signature="~/.signature"
#
# Name: signature
# Type: path
# Default: "~/.signature"
# 
# 
# Specifies the filename of your signature, which is appended to all
# outgoing messages.   If the filename ends with a pipe (``|''), it is
# assumed that filename is a shell command and input should be read from
# its stdout.
# 
# 
# set simple_search="~f %s | ~s %s"
#
# Name: simple_search
# Type: string
# Default: "~f %s | ~s %s"
# 
# 
# Specifies how Mutt should expand a simple search into a real search
# pattern.  A simple search is one that does not contain any of the ~
# operators.  See ``patterns'' for more information on search patterns.
# 
# For example, if you simply type joe at a search or limit prompt, Mutt
# will automatically expand it to the value specified by this variable.
# For the default value it would be:
# 
# ~f joe | ~s joe
# 
# 
# set smart_wrap=yes
#
# Name: smart_wrap
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# Controls the display of lines longer then the screen width in the
# internal pager. If set, long lines are wrapped at a word boundary.  If
# unset, lines are simply wrapped at the screen edge. Also see the
# ``$markers'' variable.
# 
# 
# set smileys="(>From )|(:[-^]?[][)(><}{|/DP])"
#
# Name: smileys
# Type: regular expression
# Default: "(>From )|(:[-^]?[][)(><}{|/DP])"
# 
# 
# The pager uses this variable to catch some common false
# positives of ``$quote_regexp'', most notably smileys in the beginning
# of a line
# 
# 
# set sleep_time=1
#
# Name: sleep_time
# Type: number
# Default: 1
# 
# 
# Specifies time, in seconds, to pause while displaying certain informational
# messages, while moving from folder to folder and after expunging
# messages from the current folder.  The default is to pause one second, so 
# a value of zero for this option suppresses the pause.
# 
# 
# set sort=date
#
# Name: sort
# Type: sort order
# Default: date
# 
# 
# Specifies how to sort messages in the index menu.  Valid values
# are:
# 
#    date or date-sent
#    date-received
#    from
#    mailbox-order (unsorted)
#    score
#    size
#    subject
#    threads
#    to
# 
# You may optionally use the reverse- prefix to specify reverse sorting
# order (example: set sort=reverse-date-sent).
# 
# 
# set sort_alias=alias
#
# Name: sort_alias
# Type: sort order
# Default: alias
# 
# 
# Specifies how the entries in the `alias' menu are sorted.  The
# following are legal values:
# 
#    address (sort alphabetically by email address)
#    alias (sort alphabetically by alias name)
#    unsorted (leave in order specified in .muttrc)
# 
# 
# set sort_aux=date
#
# Name: sort_aux
# Type: sort order
# Default: date
# 
# 
# When sorting by threads, this variable controls how threads are sorted
# in relation to other threads, and how the branches of the thread trees
# are sorted.  This can be set to any value that ``$sort'' can, except
# threads (in that case, mutt will just use date-sent).  You can also
# specify the last- prefix in addition to the reverse- prefix, but last-
# must come after reverse-.  The last- prefix causes messages to be
# sorted against its siblings by which has the last descendant, using
# the rest of sort_aux as an ordering.  For instance, set sort_aux=last-
# date-received would mean that if a new message is received in a
# thread, that thread becomes the last one displayed (or the first, if
# you have set sort=reverse-threads.) Note: For reversed ``$sort''
# order $sort_aux is reversed again (which is not the right thing to do,
# but kept to not break any existing configuration setting).
# 
# 
# set sort_browser=subject
#
# Name: sort_browser
# Type: sort order
# Default: subject
# 
# 
# Specifies how to sort entries in the file browser.  By default, the
# entries are sorted alphabetically.  Valid values:
# 
#    alpha (alphabetically)
#    date
#    size
#    unsorted
# 
# You may optionally use the reverse- prefix to specify reverse sorting
# order (example: set sort_browser=reverse-date).
# 
# 
# set sort_re=yes
#
# Name: sort_re
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# This variable is only useful when sorting by threads with
# ``$strict_threads'' unset.  In that case, it changes the heuristic
# mutt uses to thread messages by subject.  With sort_re set, mutt will
# only attach a message as the child of another message by subject if
# the subject of the child message starts with a substring matching the
# setting of ``$reply_regexp''.  With sort_re unset, mutt will attach
# the message whether or not this is the case, as long as the
# non-``$reply_regexp'' parts of both messages are identical.
# 
# 
# set spoolfile=""
#
# Name: spoolfile
# Type: path
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# If your spool mailbox is in a non-default place where Mutt cannot find
# it, you can specify its location with this variable.  Mutt will
# automatically set this variable to the value of the environment
# variable $MAIL if it is not set.
# 
# 
# set status_chars="-*%A"
#
# Name: status_chars
# Type: string
# Default: "-*%A"
# 
# 
# Controls the characters used by the "%r" indicator in
# ``$status_format''. The first character is used when the mailbox is
# unchanged. The second is used when the mailbox has been changed, and
# it needs to be resynchronized. The third is used if the mailbox is in
# read-only mode, or if the mailbox will not be written when exiting
# that mailbox (You can toggle whether to write changes to a mailbox
# with the toggle-write operation, bound by default to "%"). The fourth
# is used to indicate that the current folder has been opened in attach-
# message mode (Certain operations like composing a new mail, replying,
# forwarding, etc. are not permitted in this mode).
# 
# 
# set status_format="-%r-Mutt: %f [Msgs:%?M?%M/?%m%?n? New:%n?%?o? Old:%o?%?d? Del:%d?%?F? Flag:%F?%?t? Tag:%t?%?p? Post:%p?%?b? Inc:%b?%?l? %l?]---(%s/%S)-%>-(%P)---"
#
# Name: status_format
# Type: string
# Default: "-%r-Mutt: %f [Msgs:%?M?%M/?%m%?n? New:%n?%?o? Old:%o?%?d? Del:%d?%?F? Flag:%F?%?t? Tag:%t?%?p? Post:%p?%?b? Inc:%b?%?l? %l?]---(%s/%S)-%>-(%P)---"
# 
# 
# Controls the format of the status line displayed in the index
# menu.  This string is similar to ``$index_format'', but has its own
# set of printf()-like sequences:
# 
# %b      number of mailboxes with new mail *
# %d      number of deleted messages *
# %h      local hostname
# %f      the full pathname of the current mailbox
# %F      number of flagged messages *
# %l      size (in bytes) of the current mailbox *
# %L      size (in bytes) of the messages shown 
#         (i.e., which match the current limit) *
# %m      the number of messages in the mailbox *
# %M      the number of messages shown (i.e., which match the current limit) *
# %n      number of new messages in the mailbox *
# %o      number of old unread messages
# %p      number of postponed messages *
# %P      percentage of the way through the index
# %r      modified/read-only/won't-write/attach-message indicator,
#         according to $status_chars
# %s      current sorting mode ($sort)
# %S      current aux sorting method ($sort_aux)
# %t      number of tagged messages *
# %u      number of unread messages *
# %v      Mutt version string
# %V      currently active limit pattern, if any *
# %>X     right justify the rest of the string and pad with "X"
# %|X     pad to the end of the line with "X"
# 
# 
# * = can be optionally printed if nonzero
# 
# Some of the above sequences can be used to optionally print a string
# if their value is nonzero.  For example, you may only want to see the
# number of flagged messages if such messages exist, since zero is not
# particularly meaningful.  To optionally print a string based upon one
# of the above sequences, the following construct is used
# 
# %?<sequence_char>?<optional_string>?
# 
# where sequence_char is a character from the table above, and
# optional_string is the string you would like printed if
# status_char is nonzero.  optional_string may contain
# other sequence as well as normal text, but you may not nest
# optional strings.
# 
# Here is an example illustrating how to optionally print the number of
# new messages in a mailbox:
# %?n?%n new messages.?
# 
# Additionally you can switch between two strings, the first one, if a
# value is zero, the second one, if the value is nonzero, by using the
# following construct:
# %?<sequence_char>?<if_string>&<else_string>?
# 
# You can additionally force the result of any printf-like sequence to
# be lowercase by prefixing the sequence character with an underscore
# (_) sign.  For example, if you want to display the local hostname in
# lowercase, you would use:
# %_h
# 
# 
# set status_on_top=no
#
# Name: status_on_top
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# Setting this variable causes the ``status bar'' to be displayed on
# the first line of the screen rather than near the bottom.
# 
# 
# set strict_threads=no
#
# Name: strict_threads
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# If set, threading will only make use of the ``In-Reply-To'' and
# ``References'' fields when you ``$sort'' by message threads.  By
# default, messages with the same subject are grouped together in
# ``pseudo threads.''  This may not always be desirable, such as in a
# personal mailbox where you might have several unrelated messages with
# the subject ``hi'' which will get grouped together.
# 
# 
# set suspend=yes
#
# Name: suspend
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When unset, mutt won't stop when the user presses the terminal's
# susp key, usually ``control-Z''. This is useful if you run mutt
# inside an xterm using a command like xterm -e mutt.
# 
# 
# set text_flowed=no
#
# Name: text_flowed
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will generate text/plain; format=flowed attachments.
# This format is easier to handle for some mailing software, and generally
# just looks like ordinary text.  To actually make use of this format's 
# features, you'll need support in your editor.
# 
# Note that $indent_string is ignored when this option is set.
# 
# 
# set thread_received=no
#
# Name: thread_received
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, mutt uses the date received rather than the date sent
# to thread messages by subject.
# 
# 
# set thorough_search=no
#
# Name: thorough_search
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# Affects the ~b and ~h search operations described in
# section ``patterns'' above.  If set, the headers and attachments of
# messages to be searched are decoded before searching.  If unset,
# messages are searched as they appear in the folder.
# 
# 
# set tilde=no
#
# Name: tilde
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# When set, the internal-pager will pad blank lines to the bottom of the
# screen with a tilde (~).
# 
# 
# set timeout=600
#
# Name: timeout
# Type: number
# Default: 600
# 
# 
# This variable controls the number of seconds Mutt will wait for
# a key to be pressed in the main menu before timing out and checking
# for new mail.  A value of zero or less will cause Mutt not to ever
# time out.
# 
# 
# set tmpdir=""
#
# Name: tmpdir
# Type: path
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# This variable allows you to specify where Mutt will place its
# temporary files needed for displaying and composing messages.
# 
# 
# set to_chars=" +TCFL"
#
# Name: to_chars
# Type: string
# Default: " +TCFL"
# 
# 
# Controls the character used to indicate mail addressed to you.  The
# first character is the one used when the mail is NOT addressed to your
# address (default: space).  The second is used when you are the only
# recipient of the message (default: +).  The third is when your address
# appears in the TO header field, but you are not the only recipient of
# the message (default: T).  The fourth character is used when your
# address is specified in the CC header field, but you are not the only
# recipient.  The fifth character is used to indicate mail that was sent
# by you.  The sixth character is used to indicate when a mail
# was sent to a mailing-list you subscribe to (default: L).
# 
# 
# set tunnel=""
#
# Name: tunnel
# Type: string
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# Setting this variable will cause mutt to open a pipe to a command
# instead of a raw socket. You may be able to use this to set up
# preauthenticated connections to your IMAP/POP3 server. Example:
# 
# tunnel="ssh -q mailhost.net /usr/local/libexec/imapd"
# 
# NOTE: For this example to work you must be able to log in to the remote
# machine without having to enter a password.
# 
# 
# set use_8bitmime=no
#
# Name: use_8bitmime
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
# 
# 
# Warning: do not set this variable unless you are using a version
# of sendmail which supports the -B8BITMIME flag (such as sendmail
# 8.8.x) or you may not be able to send mail.
# 
# When set, Mutt will invoke ``$sendmail'' with the -B8BITMIME
# flag when sending 8-bit messages to enable ESMTP negotiation.
# 
# 
# set use_domain=yes
#
# Name: use_domain
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, Mutt will qualify all local addresses (ones without the
# @host portion) with the value of ``$hostname''.  If unset, no
# addresses will be qualified.
# 
# 
# set use_from=yes
#
# Name: use_from
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, Mutt will generate the `From:' header field when
# sending messages.  If unset, no `From:' header field will be
# generated unless the user explicitly sets one using the ``my_hdr''
# command.
# 
# 
# set use_ipv6=yes
#
# Name: use_ipv6
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, Mutt will look for IPv6 addresses of hosts it tries to
# contact.  If this option is unset, Mutt will restrict itself to IPv4 addresses.
# Normally, the default should work.
# 
# 
# set user_agent=yes
#
# Name: user_agent
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will add a "User-Agent" header to outgoing
# messages, indicating which version of mutt was used for composing
# them.
# 
# 
# set visual=""
#
# Name: visual
# Type: path
# Default: ""
# 
# 
# Specifies the visual editor to invoke when the ~v command is
# given in the builtin editor.
# 
# 
# set wait_key=yes
#
# Name: wait_key
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# Controls whether Mutt will ask you to press a key after shell-
# escape, pipe-message, pipe-entry, print-message,
# and print-entry commands.
# 
# It is also used when viewing attachments with ``auto_view'', provided
# that the corresponding mailcap entry has a needsterminal flag,
# and the external program is interactive.
# 
# When set, Mutt will always ask for a key. When unset, Mutt will wait
# for a key only if the external command returned a non-zero status.
# 
# 
# set weed=yes
#
# Name: weed
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# When set, mutt will weed headers when when displaying, forwarding,
# printing, or replying to messages.
# 
# 
# set wrap_search=yes
#
# Name: wrap_search
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# Controls whether searches wrap around the end of the mailbox.
# 
# When set, searches will wrap around the first (or last) message. When
# unset, searches will not wrap.
# 
# 
# set wrapmargin=0
#
# Name: wrapmargin
# Type: number
# Default: 0
# 
# 
# Controls the margin left at the right side of the terminal when mutt's
# pager does smart wrapping.
# 
# 
# set write_inc=10
#
# Name: write_inc
# Type: number
# Default: 10
# 
# 
# When writing a mailbox, a message will be printed every
# write_inc messages to indicate progress.  If set to 0, only a
# single message will be displayed before writing a mailbox.
# 
# Also see the ``$read_inc'' variable.
# 
# 
# set write_bcc=yes
#
# Name: write_bcc
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
# 
# 
# Controls whether mutt writes out the Bcc header when preparing
# messages to be sent.  Exim users may wish to use this.

6.1  crontab entries -- location: /var/cron/tabs/root 
     
     a.  location: 
	 /var/cron/tabs/root
	 /var/cron/tabs/$USER
     b.  vulnerabilities file downloaded daily

      You may wish to have the vulnerabilities file downloaded daily so that
      it remains current.  This may be done by adding an appropriate entry
      to the root users crontab(5) entry.  For example the entry

      # download vulnerabilities file
      0 3 * * * /usr/pkg/sbin/download-vulnerability-list >/dev/null 2>&1

      will update the vulnerability list every day at 3AM. You may wish to do
      this more often than once a day.


     c. package audit

      In addition, you may wish to run the package audit from the daily
      security script.  This may be accomplished by adding the following
      lines to /etc/security.local

      if [ -x /usr/pkg/sbin/audit-packages ]; then
	      /usr/pkg/sbin/audit-packages
      fi

	 % ls -l !*

 8.2  csh environment customization 

     a.  csh environment customization files 
        i.  .login
        ii.  .logout
        iii.  .cshrc
              setenv http_proxy "http://192.168.1.1:3128"
        iv.  /etc/csh.cshrc

     c.  Filename Completion
        i.  ctrl-d  -- is used to show names upon beep
        ii.  esc -- is used to complete the filename expansion
        iii.  set filec -- must be within .cshrc
        iv.  set history=5 --

     d.  {list,...} expansion
    
        i.  difference between list expansion and filename expansion is that the former expands filenames and other texts. List
	    expansions are not limited to filenames only.

        ii.  set path = ( /{s,,usr/{s,,openwin/,X11R6/}}bin )
	     set path = ( /sbin /bin /usr/sbin /usr/bin /usr/openwin/bin /usr/X11R6/bin )
        iii.  mv source.c{,.old}
	      mv source.c source.c.old
        iv.  for each host ( 100.1.{10,20}.{1,2,3,4} )
             echo ::: $host :::
             finger -s user@$host
             end
    
        v.  Another important point about {list,...} expansion is that the list is expanded exactly in the order
            specified. This contrasts with normal filename expansion, which is always sorted alphabetically.

--begin snip ircrc--

Once you've familiarised yourself with IRC, you can use your .ircrc file
to personalise your client to taste, as well as save typing the same things
every time you enter the system. Your .ircrc file is an ircII "script"; it
contains commands which are run by the client every time you enter IRC.
The commands don't have to have the command character '/' that you would
use to enter a command while using IRC, thus you could begin your file
with "nick jane" instead of typing "/nick jane" each time you use IRC.

An example file follows; the text after a '#' character on a line is
a comment, and is just included for explanation. 

#set display off        # silently turn off the display so we don't have
                        # to watch all this stuff happening every time
nick rac3rx             # set your preferred nickname
server irc.nullus.net   # preferred irc server 
join #bw-dialup         # join your usual channel
#set display on         # turn the display back on so we can see to chat

The "set display" lines should come first and last; they simply tell
the client program not to print the results of any commands in between,
so that you don't see the same sequence of automatic commands performed
each time you enter IRC.

Some slightly more advanced .ircrc commands might include:

set novice off          # some example variable settings, read the online
set auto_unmark_away on #   help for SET for descriptions, and others

bind ^I switch_channels
bind ^V quote_character # and some key "bindings"; ^I is the "tab" key

alias ? help            # some convenient aliases to save keystrokes
alias l leave *         # leave the current channel
alias m msg
alias , msg ,           # reply to the last person who sent you a message
alias . msg .           # send again to the last person you msg'd

ircII is pretty customisable, so if you don't like something, go ahead
and change it in your .ircrc file. Read the help files on "alias", "bind"
"on" and "set" for more information on the commands used to customise
different aspects of the client.

  a.  boot the INSTALL kernel with boot-d
In order to work around this at installation time, you may boot the INSTALL                                                       
kernel with boot-d, in order to enter ddb(4) (the in-kernel debugger), and                                                        
then use the write command to alter the variable values:

Chapter 45  NetBSD Mirrors 

  a.  

Chapter 46  Beakers 

A. FTP => NetBSD.org or associated mirrors.                                                                                   
B. CDROMS => www.edmunds-enterprises.com (most CDs $1.50 ; Linux too!); www.bsdmall.com ; www.bsdcentral.com ;               
www.cheapbytes.com
C. Wasabi Systems - "The NetBSD Company"=>www.wasabisystems.com/
D. Your geeky friends.          

IV. NetBSD Documentation, Support & News                                                                                  
A. First stop is www.netbsd.org => man pages, HowTos, U.M., mail lists ; Noteworthy Newbie lists: netbsd-help@netbsd.org &   
port-i386@netbsd.org                                        
B. Fredrico Lupi's User Manual (see above) => html online; downloadable .ps & .rtf versions. * the .ps version lacks the
figure graphics (bug?). Print & bind @ Kinkos ~$10
C. Usernet => comp.unix.bsd.netbsd.misc & comp.unix.bsd.netbsd.announce
D. *BSD News/Apps => Daemon News; BSD Today; Maximum BSD; google.com/bsd                                            
E. *BSD IRC Server=> irc.us.bsdirc.net (W. Coast) @ http://www.bsdirc.net (has several international IRCs are avail + mailing
lists)                                                                                                               
F. NetBSD on Laptops => http://www.reedmedia.net/misc/netbsd/laptops-and-netbsd.html ; http://mobilix.org/ ; Toshiba stands
out
B. Installation process doesn't allow FS to span multiple disks => must be done post-installation => see manual and FAQ for
info on disklabel, newfs, mount, & fstab
ex. To /etc/fstab add the following lines:                                                                                  
/dev/fd0a /floppy msdos rw,noauto 0 0
/dev/cd0a /cdrom cd9660 ro,noauto 0 0    
Now you can just type (u)mount /cdrom and (u)mount /floppy as needed.
F. Set the Clock. Note: If you want to utilize the pkgsrc tool for patching and updating your packages you'll have to tell the
kernel to do a Remote Time Clock (RTC) offset; basically the kernel will think its on Greenwich Mean Time (UTC). Do this like   
so:                                                                                                                        
# gdb --write /netbsd (netbsd is the generic kernel name)
(gdb) set rtc_offset=#min. west of UTC       
(gdb) quit                
Now you'll need to configure system for the local time:
# rm -f /etc/localtime
# ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/<continent>/<country>/localtime                                                              
# date [[[[[cc]yy]mm]dd]hh]mm Thats it!
B. GUI Browsers: Dillo, Chimera, Grail, Mosaic & clones, Opera. Avoid Netscape, Mozilla & Konqueror (bloated).
C. Graphics: xv - lightweight, full featured graphics program (shareware)
D. rxvt => low mem version of xterm w/ colors, cut/paste and scroll                                                          
E. xnc => file manager for X


Chapter 47  mk.conf


What to put in /etc/mk.conf                                                                                    
In order to get a sane build environment and to build sane packages out of your environment, you should consider overriding
some default values in your /etc/mk.conf. For example, if you are running NetBSD/alpha, you shouldn't use any optimizations to
cc(1), because gcc is still buggy on Alpha. And in general you should think twice before setting the optimization level above
2, because this might cause several programs to segfault frequently or not run at all. Here are some lines from my mk.conf,      
which might help you (they will honor all default values but -O*):                              
COMMONCFLAGS?=-O2 -pipe                                                                                                
COPTS:=${COMMONCFLAGS} ${COPTS:C/-O[0-9]*//g}                                                       
CFLAGS:=${COMMONCFLAGS} ${CFLAGS:C/-O[0-9]*//g}                                                                             
CXXFLAGS:=${COMMONCFLAGS} ${CXXFLAGS:C/-O[0-9]*//g}                                                                         
When trying to fix bugs in packages, it is helpful to append -Wall -Werror to COMMONCFLAGS, but beware: This might break a lot
of configure scripts (so, you have the chance to fix them too ;-). Another needful thing to have in your mk.conf is support
for sudo instead of the default su(1), so you may need not to type the root password everytime you install a package as a   
user. Here are the lines from my mk.conf:                                                                                     
.if exists(/usr/pkg/bin/sudo)                                                                                          
SU_CMD=/usr/pkg/bin/sudo /bin/sh -c
.endif                                
Another helpful thing to do, is to override the default MASTER_SITE with faster (local) mirrors. E.g. I have a local NetBSD
mirror (thats the tatooine.kosmos.all line, so don't simply copy&paste to your mk.conf :-), from where pkgsrc should try to
fetch the needed distfiles first and after that fails, it will try several other mirrors, and only if a distfile cannot be   
found there, it'll try to fetch it from the MASTER_SITEs specified for the package. Here are the lines from my mk.conf:
MASTER_SITE_OVERRIDE+= \

Chapter 48  Creating install boot floppies for i386  
                                                                                                                                    
First  of  all,  you  need  to  be  running a kernel with the vnd pseudo device enabled (this is the default for a GENERIC       
kernel.).                                                                                                                        
1. First,  you must create a valid kernel to put on your floppies, let's call it FLOPPY. This kernel must be derived from       
some INSTALL model. Then, you have a valid /sys/arch/i386/compile/FLOPPY/netbsd file.                                        
2. Go to /usr/src/distrib/i386/floppies/ramdisk and do                                                                          
# make                                                                                                                              
This will create the ramdisk.fs file in the directory.                                                                       
3. Go to /usr/src/distrib/i386/floppies/fdset and do                                                                            
# make KERN=/sys/arch/i386/compile/FLOPPY/netbsd                                                                                    
This will create one or two (depending on the size of kernel) files named boot1.fs and boot2.fs                              
4. Transfer these files to the floppies with the commands                                                                       
# dd if=boot1.fs of=/dev/fd0a bs=36b                                                                                                
# dd if=boot2.fs of=/dev/fd0a bs=36b                                                                                                
5. Put the first floppy in the drive and power on!
