Reboot your computer, or
    Run "udevadm control --reload" and then "udevadm trigger" (as root), or
    Create a symlink from extra-hdmi.conf to default.conf.



Solved my own problem....

After a day of poking around and thinking about the error message I figured there is a socket is left open or being used somewhere  and pulseaudio does not know how to handle this. I found a socket file in /tmp/.esd-UID/socket that I rm'd. 
Rebooted my laptop and logged into my Gnome desktop and there is now sound.
Furthermore I removed the line in /etc/pulse/default.pa that loads module-esound-protocol and have not ran in to any issues.
