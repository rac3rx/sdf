              Just for today

          <p>
           1921 Boston Globe, author was Frank Crane, column: DR CRANE SAYS, title: Just for Today
          </p>
          <p>
                Here are ten resolutions to make when you awake in the morning.
          </p>
          <p>
    They are Just for One Day. Think of them not as a life task but as a day's work.
          </p>
          <p>
    These things will give you pleasure. Yet they require will power. You don't need resolutions to do what is easy.
          </p>
          <p>
    1. Just for Today, I will try to live through this day only, and not tackle my whole life-problem at once. I can do some things for twelve hours that would appall me if I felt I had to keep them up for a lifetime.
          </p>
          <p>
    2. Just for Today, I will be Happy. This assumes that what Abraham Lincoln said is true, that most folks are about as happy as they make up their minds to be. Happiness is from Within; it is not a matter of Externals.
          </p>
          <p>
    3. Just for Today, I will Adjust myself to what Is, and not try to Adjust everything to my own desires. I will take my family, my business, and my luck as they come, and fit myself to them.
          </p>
          <p>
    4. Just for Today, I will take care of my Body. I will exercise it, care for it, and nourish it, and not abuse it nor neglect it; so that it will be a perfect machine for my will.
          </p>
          <p>
    5. Just for Today, I will try to strengthen my mind, I will study. I will learn something useful, I will not be a mental loafer all day. I will read something that requires effort, though and concentration.
          </p>
          <p>
    6. Just for Today, I will exercise my Soul. In three ways, to wit:
          </p>
          <p>
    (a) I will do somebody a good turn and not get found out. If anybody knows of it, it will not count.
          </p>
          <p>
    (b) I will do at least two things I don't want to do, as William James suggests just for exercise.
          </p>
          <p>
    (c) I will not show any one that my feelings are hurt. They may be hurt, but Today I will not show it.
          </p>
          <p>
    7. Just for To-day, I will be agreeable. I will look as well as I can, dress as becomingly as possible,  talk low,  act courteously, be liberal with flattery, criticize not one bit  nor find fault with anything, and not try to regulate nor improve anybody.
          </p>
          <p>
    8. Just for Today, I will have a Programme. I will write down just what I expect to do every hour. I may not follow it exactly, but Iâ€™ll have it. It will save me from the two pests Hurry and Indecision.
          </p>
          <p>
    9. Just for Today, I will have a quiet half hour, all by myself, and relax. During this half hour, some time, I will think of God, so as to get a little more perspective to my life.
          </p>
          <p>
    10. Just for Today, I will be Unafraid. Especially I will not be afraid to be Happy, to enjoy what is Beautiful, to love and to believe that those I love love me.

    Dignare, Domine, die isto, sine peccato nos custodire.
          </p>
          <p>

    Lord, for to-morrow and its needs I do not pray;
          </p>
          <p>
    Keep me, my God, from stain of sin, Just for to-day
          </p>
          <p>
    Let me both diligently work And duly pray;
          </p>
          <p>
    Let me be kind in word and deed, Just for to-day.
          </p>
          <p>
    Let me be slow to do my will, Prompt to obey;
          </p>
          <p>
    Help me to mortify my flesh, Just for to-day.
          </p>
          <p>
    Let me no wrong or idle word Unthinking, say;
          </p>
          <p>
    Set Thou a seal upon my lips, Just for to-day.
          </p>
          <p>
    Let me in season, Lord, be grave, In season, gay;
          </p>
          <p>
    Let me be faithful to Thy grace, Just for to-day,
          </p>
          <p>
    And if to-day my tide of life Should ebb away,
          </p>
          <p>
    Give me Thy sacraments divine, Sweet Lord, to-day.
          </p>
          <p>
    In Purgatory's cleansing fires Brief be my stay;
          </p>
          <p>
    O bid me, if to-day I die, Go home to-day.
          </p>
          <p>
    So, for to-morrow and its needs I do not pray;
          </p>
          <p>
    But keep me, guide me, love me, Lord, Just for to-day
          </p>
