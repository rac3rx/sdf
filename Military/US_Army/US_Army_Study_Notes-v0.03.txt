3.2 Cadences


Cadence calls are songs (usually delivered in an eight count movement) that the
military sing when marching or running. The songs r 
equire a Caller, who normally sets the pace and leads the formation. The caller
starts each line on his left foot. The formation th 
en repeats the line, starting on the left foot. If everything goes well, the
caller and the formation develop a sort of rapport. Th 
e effect can be mesmerizing. The way a unit sounds while running or marching
tends to reflect on that unit's morale and leadership. 
-Drill Sgt. Timothy P. Dunnigan, US Army
                                                   

                                                   
Basics
                                                   
Caller always start your line on the left foot
Formation should do the same
Cadences are used to keep everyone together
Caller needs to stay in step with formation
It actually does feel good when everyone is together
Caller needs to stay in the rear third of the formation
Everyone needs to be able to hear
Concentrate on voice strength as well as enunciation
Realize there are a hundred versions of each cadence
Make your own variations, adapt a cadence to your particular formation
Clap on left foot when not singing cadences

C-130 rollin' down the strip
Airborne Daddy gonna take a little
trip                                                 
Mission Top Secret, destination
unknown                                                 
Don't even know if they're ever
coming home                                               
Stand up, hook up, shuffle to the
door                                                 
Jump right out and count to
four                                                    
But if my main don't open wide
I got a reserve by my side
But if that one should fail me
too                                                   
Look out below I'm a-comin'
through                                                   
If I die on the old drop zone
Box me up and ship me home
Pin my wings upon my chest
And bury me in the leaning rest
