C-130 

C-130 rolling down the strip,
Airborne daddy on a one way trip.
Mission top secret, destination unknown,
Don't even know if were comin home
Stand up, hook up, shuffle to the door,
Jump right out and count to four.
If my main don't open wide,
I got a reserve by my side.
If that one should fail me too,
Look out ground, I'm a comin through.
If I die in the old drop zone,
Box me up and ship me home.
If I die on a Afghan hill,
Box me up or the Taliban will.
If I die in the Iraqi sand.
Honor me with the Army band. 
Pin my medals upon my chest,  
Bury me in the leaning rest.

========================================

SOME SAY FREEDOM IS FREE

Some say freedom is free,
but I tend to disagree. 
Some say freedom is won,
through the barrel of a gun. 
My daddy gave up his life,
so that you could have your right.
On the night my daddy left,
the air was cold the ground was wet.
They put him on a silver jet.
It was a night I won't forget.

Some say freedom is free,
but I tend to disagree.
Some say freedom is won,
through the barrel of a gun. 
There was a knock knock at the door.
My momma knew what was in store.
On that night my daddy died.
Oh, my momma she was crying.

Some say freedom is free,
but I tend to disagree.
Some say freedom is won,
through the barrel of a gun. 
Many years have come and gone,
my momma still lives all alone.

Some say freedom is free,
but I tend to disagree.
Some say freedom is won,
through the barrel of a gun.
Some say freedom is free,
but I tend to disagree.
